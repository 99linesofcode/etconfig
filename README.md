# Wolfenstein Enemy Territory configuration

This repository contains my personal config for Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory optimized for ET:Legacy and Bani's mod (ET:Pro). With binds, a collection of scripts gathered and modified over the years as well as an exhaustive list of settings, thoroughly documented. Many thanks to people the likes of [Antman](https://antman.info/) without whom compiling this configuration file would have been many times more difficult.

## ET:Legacy

ET:Legacy expands upon the cvarlist as it was available in ET 2.6b both by introducing new configuration options as well as removing obsolete or unused cvars.

For more information on ET:Legacy specific configuration, see: <https://etlegacy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

## Contributing

I would love for this config to serve as a starting point for new and old players alike. It could also prove useful for developers currently working on ETL. Pull requests to update the cvars add descriptions or expand upon descriptions are always welcome.
